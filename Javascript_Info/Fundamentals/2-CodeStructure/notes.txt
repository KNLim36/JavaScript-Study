JavaScript takes line breaks as implicit semicolons. (Automatic semicolon insertion)

There are exceptions to this rule, like:

alert(3 +
1
+ 2);

alert("Hello")
[1, 2].forEach(alert);

One-line comments //
Multi-line comments /* */

Nested comments are not supported. There may not be /*...*/ inside another /*...*/.
