First we have to understand operator and operand.

Operator operates on operands.

For example, a simple mathematical expression: 5 + 2 has 2 operands (5 and 2) and a operator (+).

The term "Unary" means singular, one.

And so, unary operator means an operator that operates on 1 operand only.

These unary operators are available in JavaScript:
- Unary plus (+)        Attempts to convert operand to a number if it is not a number.
- Unary negation (-)    Attempts to convert operand to a number, then negates it.
- Increment (++)        Adds one to its operand.
- Decrement (--)        Minus one from its operand.
- Logical NOT (!)       Converts to boolean then negates it.
- Bitwise NOT (~)       Invert all the bits in the operand then returns a number.
- typeof                Returns a string which is the type of the operand.
- delete                Deletes specific index of an array or specific property of an object.
- void                  Discards a return value of an expression. (Result is undefined.)
