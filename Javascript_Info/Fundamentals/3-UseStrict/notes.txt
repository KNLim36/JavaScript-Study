When 2009 came around and ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared, there was a need to modify
old JavaScript functionalities, and that results in breaking old implementations.

The "use strict" keyword is then introduced to work "modernly".

"use strict" when declared late in the script only applies to the code below it.

There is no way to cancel "use strict".

Modern JavaScript features like "class" and "module" enable "use strict" directly.
