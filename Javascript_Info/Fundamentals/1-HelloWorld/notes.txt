Old HTML standard like HTML4 requires a script to have a type, hence we see

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"> 
//...
</script>

src="script.js" and src="./script.js" both mean script.js in the current folder.

Browser keep downloaded scripts in a cache to reduce traffic and load faster.

If src is set, script content is ignored.
