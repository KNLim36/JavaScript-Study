Use the "let" keyword to store named data.

In older scripts, we might find "var" keyword for variable declaration.

Double variable declarations result in an error.

Some functional languages like Scala and Erlang do not allow variable value change.

Variable names must contain only letters, digits or symbols like $ and _.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
The first character must not be a digit.

In JavaScript camelCase is more commonly used.
Hyphens are not allowed.

Reserved words are not allowed to be used as variable names:
- let
- class
- return
- function

In older JavaScript it is possible to assign to an uninitialized variable like so:

num = 5; // Assignment is successful 
alert(num); // 5
