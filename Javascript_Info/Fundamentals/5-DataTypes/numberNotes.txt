Number
- Represents both integers and floating point numbers.
- Number is 64 bit.
- Allows operations like:
    - Multiplication (*)
    - Division (/)
    - Addition (+)
    - Subtraction (-)
    - Modulus (%)
- Special numeric values are available in JavaScript too, like:
    - Infinity
    - -Infinity
    - NaN

NaN happens when a computational error happens.
Further operations on NaN keep producing more NaNs.

Nan ** 0 is 1

BigInt
- Represent values bigger than 2^53 or smaller than -2^53
- Declared by appending "n" to the end of an integer

const bigInt = 1234214671824612784627814684n;
