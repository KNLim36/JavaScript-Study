The "undefined" value has its own type just like "null"

When a variable is declared but not assigned it gets an "undefined"

let age;
alert(age) // shows "undefined"

Normally we use "null" to represent a value that means nothing.
"undefined" is used to represent the fact that a variable has
not been declared.

let accountingSkills = null;
// Means I don't have accounting skills

let moneyInWallet = 100; 
moneyInWallet = undefined;
// This represents me losing my wallet
